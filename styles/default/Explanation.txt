Hi,

If you ever want to make your own style, please read this carefully before.

Make a new folder named by your style. Then create subfolders for the images and for the css.

Make your own template page on two parts (header.php and footer.php). Your header.php should start at the <body> part.

The links to indexes are like this : <a href="index.php"><?php echo "$lgMINDEX";?></a>


"yourheader" is used for your personnal need (eg: Google Analytics). The "globalheader" file shouldn't be touched.

Well overhall, i guess it's more talking to take a look on the examples ;)
